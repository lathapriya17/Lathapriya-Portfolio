# [Project 1: Income Analysis of MLB players:Overview](https://github.com/lathapriya17/Lathapriya-Portfolio)
* Major League Baseball: mlb.csv . Data on salaries and other information (such as race, position and performance information) on baseball players in MLB in 1993
* Loading the dataset
* Data cleaning and Data Manupulation
* Analysing the performance of the players
* Analysing the income of the  players for the number of years and games they have played and finding how they are related.
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualizing the data

### Findings from the Analysis
* The highest number of games played by the player was 2729 games and the average games played by a player was 645 games.
* The average home runs of the player is 54 and there are 106 players whose home runs are  higher than the average.
* Most of the players played in outfield position.

# [Project 2: Used Car Price Prediction: Overview](https://github.com/lathapriya17/Lathapriya-Portfolio)
* In this porject, we are going to do End to end Machine Learning project.
* Starting first sampling data into two part such train and test dataset.
* After that,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done which is an approach for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques to maximize insight into a data set;uncover underlying structure;extract important variables;detect outliers;develop parsimonious models.
* Finally data preprocessing is done for algorthirm model
